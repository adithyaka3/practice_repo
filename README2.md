# This is a new readme 
this readme is created direclty in the remote github server by me as the owner.

The purpose of this creation is to test pull requests from the local git setup

## Syntax
I just got to know that a markdown file has a ton of syntax and it looks quite overwhelming so I dont underestimate the markdown file anymore!
I am now making a local change in a separate branch and this change shouldnt be relfected on the main branch
the changes that are made include the change in the readme2.md file and the python file

As of now the new branch creation is not reflected in the remote gitHub repo and hence now I am going to push this branch into the remote repo
