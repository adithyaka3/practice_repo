# This is a new readme 
this readme is created direclty in the remote github server by me as the owner.

The purpose of this creation is to test pull requests from the local git setup

I just got to know that a markdown file has a ton of syntax and it looks quite overwhelming so I dont underestimate the markdown file anymore!
